/*
  This example shows how to fade an RGB LED through the hues, using the hsl2rgb library.
  
  The circuit:
  * RGB LED red lead to digital pin 9
  * RGB LED green lead to digital pin 10
  * RGB LED blue lead to digital pin 11
  For a common-cathode RGB LED:
  * RGB LED ground lead to ground pin
  For a common-anode RGB LED: (Change the commonCathode variable below)
  * RGB LED ground lead to +5V pin
